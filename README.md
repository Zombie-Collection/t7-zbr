# Information
This project was created with a custom gsc toolchain, which allows it to use the game's full feature set. \
This also means the syntax will be slightly different from the official t7 modtools. \
The only script which is not included is the elo system script, due to a proprietary protection from cheaters. \
The script's loader is obfuscated, and the scripts are somewhat protected from decompilation.
